/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: wil not assert if top is NULL. I explained
        in Reflection section.


        -Implemented: It works as a Stack. Items will be inserted on
        top and will be removed from top. Program will assert if user
        pop on empty Stack.

        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs: implemented features are bug-free

    Reflections: I didn't know if we are gonna assert for top function
    if top is NULL or just simply return nothing for that.
    Not sure if my assignment operator works correctly for big 3.
    It looks like it is working well.
