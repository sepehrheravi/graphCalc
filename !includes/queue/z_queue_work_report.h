    Features:
        -Not Implemented:


        -Implemented: It works as a Queue. Items will be inserted from
        back and will be removed from front. Program will assert if user
        pop on empty Queue.

        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs: implemented features are bug-free

    Reflections: Not sure if ctor and big 3 are completely right
    although I tested them and they seem ok.
    I had to define a function to get _head_ptr node from Iterated_list
    to use on Queue class
