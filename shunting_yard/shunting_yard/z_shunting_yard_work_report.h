/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: Integers and double are not seperated



        -Implemented: The shunting yard algorithm will output a Queue
        that makes the RPN process easier


        -Partly implemented: None


    Bugs: implemented features are bug-free

    Reflections: I created seperated classes for integers and doubles
    but I realized there is no need for that so I created one Number
    class which is doubles.
    Also I wrote RPN inside shunting Yard although it was not part of
    this week's project, it works as long as no funcs are involved
