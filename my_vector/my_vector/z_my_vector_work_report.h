    Features:
        -Not Implemented: couldn't figure out why id doesn't give me
        any error or any display when I use index of function to find
        the index of an element that does not exist in Vector


        -Implemented: writing every predefined functions for vectors
        using a class vector plus some extra functions

        -Partly implemented: index of works fine but doesn't assert if
        element does not exist

    Bugs: implemented features are bug-free

    Reflections: got a warning not an error that said I cannot compare
    unsigned int with int since I used assert if index is out of size
